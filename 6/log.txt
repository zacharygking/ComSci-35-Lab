With my partner (Nico Magana), I served as the server(administrator) side
and these were the commands necessary on my end:
1 - ssh-keygen
this command created the RSA keys (public and private) for the ssh process
and also asked me which directory to save them in, and I chose
lab6.

2 - sudo useradd -d /home/nico -m nico
this created the user nico, which was used by nico.

3 - sudo passwd nico
this command allowed me to change the password for the user nico so that 
he could access the user.

4 - cd /home/nico
this took me to the directory owned by nico since I want nico to access here

5 - sudo mkdir .ssh
made a new directory called .ssh for nico to access

6 - sudo chown -R nico .ssh
this made the directory readable to Nico

7 - sudo chmod 700 .ssh
this gave nico the rights of ownership over the .ssh directory.

Then after nico setup a server for me in the same fashion using my steps I
used his steps to access his server:

1 - ssh-keygen
same as above

2 - ssh-copy-id -i is_rsa.pub zach@<164.67.61.255>
this command sent nicos IP adress my public key

3 - ssh-add
this command adds the private key so a password becomes unnecessary

4 - ssh -X zach@<164.67.61.255>
after this command was run i now had access to nicos server and could access
applications with GUIs like Amazon and Firefox.
