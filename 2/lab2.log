locale output was not correct, corrected this with the command:
export LC_ALL='C'

obtained the file of sorted words using the command:
sort /usr/share/dict/words >words

obtained the file containing the html of this assignment
using the command:
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs35L/assign/assign2.html

What the commands do:
tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
- This command replaces any characters that are not alphabetical
- with a newline character.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
- This command does as the previous but if there is a sequence of
- non alphabetical characters the program acts as though
- the sequence counts as a single character

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
- This command does as the previous, however the output is sorted by
- line (each line only contains alphabetical characters so are just the
- words from the file)

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
- This command does as the previous, however lines that appear
- more than once are only included a single time

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
- This command does as the previous, however each
- line(word) taken is compared with the list of
- english words. Words that dont appear in the list of english
- words are put in column 1, and words that do appear in the list
- appear in column 3, and the words on the list that dont occur 
- in the initial input appear in column 2

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
- This command does as the previous except columns 2 and 3 
- do not appear, so only words from the inital input that dont
- match any word on the list appear.

Some english words are able to pass through if they are solely
comprised of hawaiian characters such as moon.

'mispelled' hawaiian words = 401
'mispelled' english words = 39

There are many words that are 'mispelled' as hawaiian but not as english
which is expected as the webpage is in english (ex. write, worry, traditional)
There are a few words that are 'mispelled' as english but not hawaiian such as
wiki and lau.
this was done by taking text files of all the mispelled words and then
using the comm command to compare the words.
