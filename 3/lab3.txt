1. Grabbing the script
first i used wget with the download link as the arguments as follows
- wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to download coreutils-7.6.tar.gz. then to unzip this file I ran the command
- tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2. Compiling coreutils
then once in the directory of the unzipped file the following commands were
used to build the program
- ./configure --prefix="/u/cs/ugra/king/35l/3/hw"
- make
- make install
- make clean

3. Reproducing the bug
first I ran the following command
- export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
then I entered the bin directory fo the coreutils unzipped file.
then i ran the following commands:
- ls -l /bin/bash
- ./ls -l /bin/bash
the first command printed the regular expected output, whilst the
second produced the expected "bug" output.

4. Applying the patch
entered the file with emacs and edited the lines according to the diff
included with the patch.

5.
configured the make file and built the program.

6. tested on two files as the spec suggested
 and saw the correct output in both cases.
