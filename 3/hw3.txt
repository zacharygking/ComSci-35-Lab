Q1. The line was used in the section of code removed that
included the for loop. In a certain case a goto statement was
used to go to that section of the program, however since the code
utilizing the goto checkpoint was removed it was not necessary
to include, but leaving it would not have caused an issue either.

Q2: This change could cause problems in other countries such as
people not being used to interpreting the date in such format. Also

Q3. the code raises an IndexError: list index out of range, this happens
because the program isnt made to be run on files without any lines. The error
is raised because it tries to access a line, but none exist.

Q4. When the code is run in python 3 the code ends with error:
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. This is because in python3 the syntax for
raising an exception is different as it doesn't allow commas in the as
portion of the exception.
