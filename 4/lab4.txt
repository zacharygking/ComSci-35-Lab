1. to get a copy of the files the following command was run:
- git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2. used the following command as instructed
git log > ../git-log.txt

3. used the following command as instructed
git tag > ../git-tags.txt

4. to find the right commit used emacs to enter the log file
then searched for 'like this' and found the commit id to be
62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f and used the command
git format-patch -1 <commit id> --stdout > ../quote-patch.txt

5. to find the tag I emacs into git-tags.txt and saw v3.0 whcih
most likely refers to version 3 and then ran the command:
git checkout v3.0

6.  applioed the patch using the following command:
- patch -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt the only issues with the patch
was the finding a file error, but pressing return worked.

7. using the git status command it is appparent that several files
 were modified as a result of the patch.
 
8. after reverting all the changes except those to c code,
there are 6 .c files remaining when using git status.

9. used emacs to remove everything but c string
constants and was left with 6 files

10. corrected the .c files according to the .rej files using emacs
and manually checking the changes

11. removed all files by running the following commands:
git clean -n
git clean -f

12. There are 6 files that are left changed and the changes are all in the
c code manipulating or using string literal constants.

13.  built the program with the following commands
./bootstrap
./configure
make
verified that the commands were now producing the expected output

14. created a directory holding the information current held in the directory,
then checked out v3.0 and ran diff on the files with the following command:
- diffutils-3.0-patch/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0/diffutils diffutils-3.0-patch
 >quote-3.0.text.test
 
15. The sources differ in that one of the files the .c files contain code that 
utilize the ' instead of the ` which results in many of the .c files to have
the two switched. therefore the changes are not innocuous because they do
indeed change how the program runs.
